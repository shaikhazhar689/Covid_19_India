# About
## Covid 19 India (Python - Jupyter Notebook)

**Dataset Analysis: This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data in India, spanning two crucial datasets.

**COVID-19 Metrics: The first dataset includes in-depth insights into active cases, fatalities, recoveries, and mortality rates.

**Vaccination Status: The second dataset sheds light on the state-wise vaccination progress, allowing for a holistic view of the vaccination landscape.

**Tools and Libraries: Leveraging the power of Python, I applied Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, while Seaborn and Matplotlib were employed to create engaging visualizations such 
  as bar plots, line graphs, and pie charts.

**Insights Uncovered: Through rigorous analysis, I uncovered the reasons behind states with the highest and lowest cases, providing valuable insights into pandemic dynamics.

**Portfolio Enrichment: This project, crafted with precision, adds significant weightage to my portfolio as a Data Analyst, showcasing my proficiency in data analysis and visualization.

**Acknowledgment: Special thanks to Simplilearn's YouTube platform for its invaluable resources and guidance, which played a pivotal role in shaping this project and contributing to my professional growth.

This project reflects my dedication to data analysis and its application in understanding critical real-world challenges.
